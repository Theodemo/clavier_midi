# üéπ Analog Synthesizer Project ‚Äì 2020/2021

## üìå Description

This electronics project aims to design and build an **analog synthesizer** in two phases:

* **Semester 1 (S1):** Development of a **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)** generating a triangular waveform whose frequency corresponds to the MIDI note played.
* **Semester 2 (S2):** Design and integration of an **ADSR envelope generator** and a **multiplier (AD633)** to shape the amplitude of the signal, making the synthesizer‚Äôs output closer to a real musical instrument.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

* Apply electronics knowledge acquired during the academic year.
* Dimension and design a complete system meeting given specifications.
* Study and characterize subsystems experimentally.
* Build and test circuits on breadboards.
* Troubleshoot and validate functional blocks progressively.
* Learn to use and interpret technical documentation (MIDI, MCV4, op-amps, AD633, logic circuits, etc.).
* Collaborate in teams using project management tools (Agile/Kanban).
* Write a **technical report** documenting results and methodology.

### Semester 2 ‚Äì ADSR & Signal Shaping

* **Inputs from MCV4:**

  * **CV1 output:** Voltage proportional to frequency (Hz/V mode).
  * **GATE output:** Logic signal (0‚Äì12 V) indicating key press duration.

* **Functional Blocks:**

  * **Integrated VCO**: Provided module generating triangular waveform at note frequency.
  * **Envelope Generator (ADSR):**

    * Attack Time (AT): 100 ms (vs = 3 V at AT/2, vs = 4.2 V at AT).
    * Decay Time (DT): 100 ms (vs decreases to 3 V).
    * Sustain Level (SL): 2 V.
    * Release Time (RT): adjustable between 250‚Äì400 ms.
  * **Multiplier (AD633):** Mixes VCO triangular signal with ADSR envelope.
  * **Output Stage:** Adjustable amplification, headphone/speaker compatible.

* **Constraints:**

  * Power supplies: ¬±15 V for analog, +5 V regulated for digital logic (HCT family).
  * Output capacitor Cout = 0.47 ¬µF, non-polarized.
  * GATE signal levels between 9‚Äì12 V.
  * Envelope reset must be handled.
  * Monostable circuits must be retriggerable (diode compensation required).
  * ADSR implemented using switches (HEF4066), decoder (74HCT138), and control voltages.
